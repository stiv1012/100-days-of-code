# 100 days of code
- I finally decided to commit to the 100 days of code, and here's my repo.
I will not be following the 'Tutorials don't count' as my primary goal is to learn new htings trough tutorials and so.

## Started on mon 15/10/2018
My main goal will be learning React and Node.JS

#### Background
I'm a full stack (mostly front-end) developer with around 1 year of experience at the time of writing this,
and my main goal is to learn as much as i can.
